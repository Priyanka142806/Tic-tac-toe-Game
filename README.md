# Tic-tac-toe-Game

# About

Tic-tac-toe , noughts and crosses , or Xs and Os  is generally  a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
Here I have tried implementing the same game using few lines of python codes.
